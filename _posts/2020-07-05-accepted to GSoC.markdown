Hi, everyone! 

I have been accepted to participate in Google Summer of Code 2020 with ArviZ! [ArviZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/index.html) is a Python package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. 

This Google Summer of Code 2020 project aims to increase support for circular and discrete variables in the ArviZ library. ArviZ currently provides tools and diagnostics for Bayesian data analysis and it is very well supported for continuous variables. However, there is plenty of space for new developments when it comes to discrete and circular variables. As a result of this project, several new plots will be incorporated into ArviZ, for example: mosaic plot, agreement plot, circular KDE, circular histogram. On the other hand, ArviZ current implementations will be revised and extended for the circular and discrete variable setting.

I am currently in the bonding period. I am communicating with my mentors through ArviZ' Slack and Gitter as we begin to schedule and plan the best course of action for this project. 

I will share my progress in this blog when the time comes :)
