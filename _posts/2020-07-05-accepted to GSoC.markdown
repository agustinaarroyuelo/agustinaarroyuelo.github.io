Hi, everyone! 

I have been accepted to participate in Google Summer of Code 2020 with ArviZ! [ArviZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/index.html) is a Python package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. This Google Summer of Code 2020 [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6362075212808192) aims to increase support for circular and discrete variables in the ArviZ library. ArviZ currently provides tools and diagnostics for Bayesian data analysis and it is very well supported for continuous variables. However, there is plenty of space for new developments when it comes to discrete and circular variables. This project contemplates adding several new plots into ArviZ, for example: mosaic plot, agreement plot, circular KDE and circular histogram. On the other hand, ArviZ current implementations will be revised and extended for the circular and discrete variable setting.

This week the bonding period started. My mentors in this project are three of ArviZ' core developers: [Osvaldo Martin](https://github.com/aloctavodia), [Ravin Kumar](https://github.com/canyon289) and [Ari Hartikainen](https://github.com/ahartikainen). I am communicating with them through ArviZ' Slack and Gitter as we begin to schedule and plan the best course of action for this project.

I will share my progress in this blog when the time comes :)
