Today the bonding period ends and the coding phase begins. 

During these first two weeks of GSoC I have carried out activities with PyMC3. I would like to highlight two contributions to [Arviz](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz), a visualization library that collects functions that will be deprecated in PyMC3 and will be available only in Arviz.

I have contributed with these PRs: [#68](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/pull/63) and [#77](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/pull/77).

The first one is a pairplot, currently also available in PyMC3 and the second one adds diagnostic functions for leave-one-out analysis.

I am looking forward to the coding phase! :)
